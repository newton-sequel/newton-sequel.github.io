<br />The first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist. - https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Newton%27s_laws_of_motion&oldid=899643656

<br />Forces which sum to zero do not change the velocity of an object.
<br />
<br />Any reference frame that is in uniform motion with respect to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame, i.e. Galilean invariance or the principle of Newtonian relativity. - https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Newton%27s_laws_of_motion&oldid=899643656

<br />A vector sum of velocity components must be computed to calculate drag force.
<br />
<br />Changes in position and velocity can be calculated per vector component.
<br />
<br />In a centrifuge, a centripetal force is a centre-directed force which changes the velocity of an object such that it follows a circular path.
